Summary info for each run

v004:
    - stars only (very small galaxies)
    - 62 images
    - DES optical psf with spatial variation, independent in each image
    - Kolmogorov atmosphere with fwhm drawn from log normal, random shape
      uniform in 0.01 0.03
    - flux distribution roughly matches r-band data at the bright end.
    - number of stars roughly matches typical r band
    - wcs drawn from a DES exposure
    - extrapolated to the faint end
    - noise properties matched to r band exposure, a random CCD

v005
    - same as v004 but with more output images

v006
    - same as v005 but bug fixes
        - calculate hlr of psf, not gal (which is pre-psf)
        - bug setting gsparams
        - just set flux and gsparams on psf, no gal needed for a star field
